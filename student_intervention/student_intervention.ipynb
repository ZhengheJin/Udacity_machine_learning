    "**Answer: ** For this classification problem, I would choose decision tree, svm and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree\n",
    "1. This model is applied in Portfolio Diversification in Indian Share Market (ref: https://www.academia.edu/2994194/Application_of_Decision_Trees_for_Portfolio_Diversification_in_Indian_Share_Market)\n",
    "2. It is very understandable machine learning method. Once created it can be easily inspected by a human which is a great advantage in some applications. One of the coolest things about Decision Trees is they only need a table of data and they will build a classifier directly from that data without needing any up front design work to take place. To some degree properties that don't matter won't be chosen as splits and will get eventually pruned so it's very tolerant of nonsense. \n",
    "3. Simple decision trees tend to over fit the training data more so that other techniques which means you generally have to do tree pruning and tune the pruning procedures. You didn't have any upfront design cost, but you'll pay that back on tuning the trees performance. Also simple decision trees divide the data into squares so building clusters around things means it has to split a lot to encompass clusters of data. Splitting a lot leads to complex trees and raises probability you are overfitting.\n",
    "4. For this specific problem, the good thing about Decision Tree is that it is simple enough to build the model and evaluate the performance. No further concern is required for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM\n",
    "1. SVM can be used in the Exploratory Phase of Petroleum and Natural Gas (ref: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243190076_Applications_of_Support_Vector_Machines_in_the_Exploratory_Phase_of_Petroleum_and_Natural_Gas_a_Survey)\n",
    "2. There are four main advantages: Firstly it has a regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. Secondly it uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. Thirdly an SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (e.g. SMO). Lastly, it is an approximation to a bound on the test error rate, and there is a substantial body of theory behind it which suggests it should be a good idea.\n",
    "3. The disadvantages are that the theory only really covers the determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularisation and kernel parameters and choice of kernel. In a way the SVM moves the problem of over-fitting from optimising the parameters to model selection. Sadly kernel models can be quite sensitive to over-fitting the model selection criterion.\n",
    "4. For this problem, SVM will have natural advantage in dealing with overfitting compared with decision tree. Also SVM doesn't have to create rules that are parallel to the axis like decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "1. Logistic regression can be used for Business Failures Prediction of Technology Industry in Thailand (ref: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2171511)\n",
    "2. There are mainly two advantages. The first is you can include more than one explanatory variable (dependent variable) and those can either be dichotomous, ordinal, or continuous. The second is that logistic regression provides a quantified value for the strength of the association adjusting for other variables (removes confounding effects). The exponential of coefficients correspond to odd ratios for the given factor.\n",
    "3. The major disadvantages are: 1) You need enough participants with each possible set of explanatory variable. Using interaction or adding factors that a rare therefore reduce considerably the power of the analysis. This has to be carefully considered at the planning phase to make sure the sample size is large enough.\n",
    "2) If you are using a dependent variable that is not binomial, you need to test the assumption of linearity before including it in the model. This is possible by first creating dummy variables for each value of an ordinal variable or by cutting down a continuous variable in different categories, and then using them as dummy variables. Likelihood ratio test can then be used to test if the model assuming linearity is similar to the one not assuming it. This has the major advantage of increasing the power of your analysis. It can require some transformation.\n",
    "3) Logistic regression combines both binomial and normal distribution. This can sometimes cause problems. Quadrature check can be used to verify that these problems did not occur. Relative differences must be bellow 0.01 (1%) for all parameters.\n",
    "4) Defining variables to enter in the model, adding, or removing explanatory variables can be complicated and must be carefully planned. Avoid important collinearity between variables as this will cause over-adjustement. Identify potential candidates using univariate analysis with a p-value threshold above the one you wish to use at the end as negative confounding can occur. When necessary consider introducing interaction terms if you are to believe some factors might increase the effects of others on your outcome. \n",
    "4. Logistic regression will be useful for this problem because it will provide more information on the details of the result since the exponential of coefficients correspond to odd ratios for the given factor."

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
