This project is based on python and tensorflow
For details of the reqirement, please check the install.md which illustrate how to install the required packages for this project. 
GPU is strongly recommended. The running time with a 4GB GPU for the last step is about 1 hour. It would surely take more time on a CPU only machine.



Details of ipython notebook:
1. 1-data_analysis.ipynb: Dataset download and data ETL, which covers the data processing part in the report
1. 2-ConvNet.ipynb: training with smaller dataset, which covers result from 4.1-4.4
1. 3-large_data_analysis.ipynb: preparing for larger dataset, which create the dataset required for further calculation.
1. 4-large-ConvNet.ipynb: training with deeper ConvNet and longer step, which covers result for 4.5
